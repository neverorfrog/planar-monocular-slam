# Planar Monocular Slam

Project of the Probabilistic Robotics Course at Sapienza University of Rome. The goal is to develop a planar monocular slam pipeline, given a dataset made of noisy odometry and measurement made by a monocular camera. The goal is to estimate the position of the perceived landmarks and correct the drift in the odometry, based on these observations.

## Code Execution

Run the following from the root folder
```
pixi run main
```
pixi should handle everything
